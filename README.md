# Time-Series-Analysis-of-Artificial-Pancreas

### Introduction
In the United States alone, approximately 1.6 million people live with Type 1 Diabetes. Type 1 Diabetes is an autoimmune disease that affects insulin production in the pancreas. 

A healthy pancreas controls insulin production automatically, therfore controlling blood sugar levels in the body. People living with Type 1 Diabetes have pancreas that fail to perform this function, leaving them having to continuously watch out for every bite of food they eat and exercises they do to keep blood sugar levels at the proper level.

Traditional methods called for finger pricks to measure blood-sugar levels, 6 six times a day or more, then carefully balancing insulin intake with eating and activities. It requires people to have very strict regimens. Even amongst the most disciplined, people with type 1 diabetes still experience dangerously high or low blood-glucose levels that can be life threatening.

Before the medical advance of an "artificial pancreas", insulin delivery was performed in the form of needle injection after a manual calculation of the amount required. Artificial pancreas have automated this process by utilizing data science to measure blood glucose level in the body and perform timed delivery of insulin, improving quality of life of its users.

In this project, I use Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib) to extract metrics from the dataset and perform supervised and unsupervised machine learning.
